# House Price Prediction with L1 Regularization

This repository contains the code for a machine-learning model that predicts house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. The model is based on linear regression with L1 regularization (Lasso).

## Problem Statement

The goal is to predict house prices while incorporating L1 regularization to identify the most influential features and prevent overfitting.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the popular Boston Housing dataset, which is included in scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
2.Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb

## **Files**

L1_regularisation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the house price prediction model.

readme.txt: Documentation file providing information about the project.

## **Dependencies**

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy

Pandas

scikit-learn

Matplotlib

## **Results**

The model is evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), and the coefficients are visualized to showcase the impact of L1 regularization on feature selection.
